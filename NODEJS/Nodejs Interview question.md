## NODEJS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

--------------------------------------------------

1. Define Nodejs?
-> Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime Environment that is useful in developing server-side applications. OR
   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

2. Where can you use nodejs?
-> Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.
   You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites.
   You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

3. Explain REPL in Node.js.
-> REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop. REPL performs tasks related to reading, executing, printing, and looping.
   The server contains several ad-hoc Java statements that REPL can help execute. With REPL, the JavaScript can enter the shell post directly and reliably perform tasks like debugging, testing, and experimenting.

4. What is a first class function in Javascript?
-> When functions can be treated like any other variable then those functions are first-class functions. There are many other programming languages, for example, scala, Haskell, etc which follow this including JS. Now because of this function can be 
   passed as a param to another function(callback) or a function can return another function(higher-order function). map() and filter() are higher-order functions that are popularly used.

5. How do you manage packages in your node.js project?
-> It can be managed by a number of package installers and their configuration file accordingly. Out of them mostly use npm or yarn. Both provide almost all libraries of javascript with extended features of controlling environment-specific configurations. 
   To maintain versions of libs being installed in a project we use package.json and package-lock.json so that there is no issue in porting that app to a different environment.

6. How is Node.js better than other frameworks most popularly used?
-> Node.js provides simplicity in development because of its non-blocking I/O and event-based model results in short response time and concurrent processing, unlike other frameworks where developers have to use thread management.
-> It runs on a chrome v8 engine which is written in c++ and is highly performant with constant improvement.
-> Also since we will use Javascript in both the frontend and backend the development will be much faster.
-> And at last, there are sample libraries so that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
